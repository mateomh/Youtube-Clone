# YOUTUBE CLONE PAGE

> The objective of the project is to mimic a youtube video page with the navbar, the video display section and the sidebar with the upcomming videos. The base page taken was the current youtube video page .

This was the main page we tried to replicate using just CSS and HTML, so no actual videos are linked in the project or dynamic data shown.
